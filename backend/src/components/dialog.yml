        title: The focus (style) of interactive elements is visible
        help: The focus is usually a ring around an interactive element, that shows what element is selected. To test this, navigate to an interactive example of a dialog inside the documentation. It usually opens with a button of some sort. Click besides it and try to navigate to it with the 'tab' key.

        title: Buttons are focusable
        help: All interactive elements should be reachable only using the 'tab' key. You can click buttons with 'enter' or sometimes with 'space'. If you could reach a button with tab, also inside the open dialog, this criteria is fulfilled.
