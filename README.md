Welcome to Project Cactus!

"Is my favourite UI library accessible?" - "What UI Frameworks could I choose for my project that gives me a headstart in accessibility?" These are the questions project cactus tries to answer!

## Structure

The project is built on two containers:

**`frontend/`**

contains the frontend, a client for providing the website. It uses the [React library](https://reactjs.org/)

[More details](/frontend/README.md)

**`backend/`**

contains the backend of this application. It processes the db calls and handle the authentication. It's based on the [NestJs](https://nestjs.com/) processive node framework.

[More details](/backend/README.md)

## Hosting and Persistence

The newest production-ready release of this application is hosted by the Eastern Switzerland University of Applied Sciences (OST). In the background a [mongo DB](https://www.mongodb.com/) stores the test results and user profiles.
