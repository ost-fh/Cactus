        On this website, the main goal is to provide a comprehensive comparison
        of different UI libraries based on their accessibility support. We
        believe that accessibility is a fundamental aspect of creating an
        inclusive online experience, and we strive to make this website as
        accessible as possible.

      <h2>Measuring Accessibility with the Cactus Score</h2>
      <p>
        We use the Cactus Score to evaluate the accessibility of UI libraries
        featured on this website. The Cactus Score is a comprehensive assessment
        of accessibility, covering a wide range of criteria such as keyboard
        accessibility and screen reader compatibility. We use this score to help
        users identify the most accessible UI libraries for their needs.
