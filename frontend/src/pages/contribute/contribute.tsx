            <p>
              Add component tests to libraries that are interesting to you. This
              way you can verify the results for yourself, understand how it is
              scored and you help other people by increasing the testquality. To
              do this, go to the <Link to={"/libraries"}>library overview</Link>
              , open a library and add a test.
            </p>
            <h2>Add new Libraries and Versions</h2>
            <p>
              Do you need scores of a library but you could not find it on
              Cactus? Just add the library and then add some tests. If a library
              is only available in an old version, you can add the new major
              version.
